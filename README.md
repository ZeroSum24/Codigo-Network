# Firmware Distribution Framework using Blockchain Technology & IPFS

## Project Abstract ##

With the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices exponentially increasing, distributing firmware updates through the network becomes a necessity in the IoT ecosystem. This project proposes a mechanism for efficient distributed firmware updates for IoT devices. In the proposed project, the feasibility of using blockchain technology for distributing firmware updates will be evaluated experimentally. At minimum a firmware distribution scheme must implement two basic features. First, end-devices should be able to check whether their firmware version is up-to-date. Second, in case they are not, they should be able to find the address and establish connection with other end-devices that are willing to share the newest firmware. Decentralized software updates for IoT devices have many merits, they reduces update time, enable open source development and ensure devices can be maintained by the community even if the vendor goes bankrupt. In this project proposal, these high level aims are broken down and translated into specific objectives. These objectives include researching available clients (blockchains and distributed file systems) suitable for IoT devices and implementing a smart contract that will be used as a firmware repository and a distributed file system client for downloading the firmware. Finally, a methodology is proposed for translating these objectives into a prototype firmware distribution scheme. To evaluate the framework, various metrics are suggested. More specifically, the smart contract will be analyzed in terms of static security and computational performance. Finally, the client interacting with the distributed file system will be analyzed in terms of download latency and scalability.
